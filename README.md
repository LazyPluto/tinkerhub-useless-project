### Project Description
A typing test website that measures your WPM… but with a twist — the keyboard layout is jumbled or arranged alphabetically instead of QWERTY. Perfect for anyone who wants to destroy their typing muscle memory in the name of productivity… or not

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
People are typing way too fast and accurately, leading to the catastrophic issue of… finishing work earlier. This surplus free time is a menace to society, and the only way to fix it is by making typing as slow, confusing, and frustrating as possible.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We throw the keyboard layout out the window — literally! By jumbling up the keys or switching to a boring alphabetical layout, we make every typing session a wild guessing game. Say goodbye to muscle memory and hello to endless finger gymnastics, ensuring your typing speed plummets and your frustration skyrockets. Productivity? Never heard of it.
